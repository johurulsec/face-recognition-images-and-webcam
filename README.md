# Install dependency:
Opencv For Python Only For Face Recognition.

To implement face recognition using OpenCV and Python, you will need several libraries, including OpenCV, dlib, and face_recognition. 

# Step 1- Set Up Your Environment:
Create a new virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated for face recognition using opencv:

python -m venv face_recognition_env
source face_recognition_env/bin/activate  # For Unix/Mac
face_recognition_env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

Alternatively, create and activate a new conda environment:

conda create -n face_recognition_env python=3.8
conda activate face_recognition_env

# Step 2 Install OpenCV:

Using pip: pip install opencv-python
Using conda: conda install -c conda-forge opencv

# Step 3. dlib Installation

Using pip: pip install dlib
Using conda: conda install -c conda-forge dlib

# Step 4. face_recognition

Using pip: pip install face_recognition
Using conda: conda install -c conda-forge face_recognition

# File 1. Extract Face Embeddings
Create a file named extract_embeddings.py.
This script will load your dataset of images, detect faces, and extract their embeddings using dlib.
Save these embeddings to a file (e.g., embeddings.pickle).

# File 2. Recognize Faces in Images
Create a file named recognize_faces_in_images.py.
This script will load the saved embeddings and compare them with faces in new images to recognize known faces.

# File 3. Recognize Faces in Live Webcam Feed
Create a file named recognize_faces_in_webcam.py.
This script will use your webcam to detect faces in real time and compare them with the saved embeddings to recognize known faces.


# Conclusion:
We explored the implementation of python face recognition and OpenCV, providing a step-by-step guide to set up your project, extract face embeddings, and recognize faces in images and real-time webcam feeds.
